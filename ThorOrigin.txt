Origin-  Thor was born to the King of the Asgardian Gods, Odin Borson, 
and the Earth Goddess Gaea. He grew up in Asgard under Odin's tutelage 
and trained in his footsteps to one day lead Asgard. Besides Odin, his stepmother Frigga 
and his adopted brother Loki are the only family he know, alongside his best friends Sif, Balder, 
and the Warriors Three.
