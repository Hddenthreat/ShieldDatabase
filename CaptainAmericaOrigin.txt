Origin- Steve Rogers was a would-be U.S. Army enlistee rejected by recruiters because of his small
 size. He volunteers to receive a top-secret serum and transforms into a “super-soldier.” Dubbed
  Captain America and clad in a red, white, and blue costume with a matching stars-and-stripes 
  shield, Rogers joins the army.
